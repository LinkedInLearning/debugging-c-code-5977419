## Course Description

This course covers the process of finding out why a C program doesn't work. It addresses the issues of warnings and errorsâ€”and how to dive deep into the code to discover what's not happening the way a programmer intends. To resolve these issues, and address the bugs, several tools are available to the programmer. First are various techniques to monitor and output variables and checkpoints in the code to see what's going on and how far the program progresses normally. Second are tools such as an IDE debugger and the command line GNU debugger (GDB), which can output variable values and memory "dumps" as a program is running. These techniques and utilities provide the examination necessary to discover what's wrong and correct the code. Check out this course to learn these important parts of a programmer's tool chest.
